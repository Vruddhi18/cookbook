For best practices on securing API keys, refer to Google's [documentation](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6310037)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"l8g4hTRotheH"},"source":["### Setup your API key\n","\n","To run the following cell, your API key must be stored it in a Colab Secret named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
