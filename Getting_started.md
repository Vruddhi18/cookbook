# Get started with the Gemini API
The Gemini API gives you access to Gemini [models](https://ai.google.dev/models/gemini) created by [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction). Gemini models are built from the ground up to be multimodal, so you can reason seamlessly across text, images, and code. You can use these to develop an extraordinary range of applications.

**Start developing**
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2. Login with your Google account.
3. [Create](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) an API key.
4. Use a [quickstart](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Prompting.ipynb) for Python, or call the REST API [using curl](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/rest/Prompting_REST.ipynb). You can find quickstarts for more languages in the SDKs.

**Official SDKs**

The Gemini API is a REST API. You can call the API using a command line tool like `curl` , or by using one of our official SDKs:
* [Python](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-python) 
* [Node.js](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-js)
* [Dart (Flutter)](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-dart)
* [Android](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-android)
* [Swift](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-swift)
* [Go](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-go)

**Capabilities**
* Learn about the capabilities of the Gemini API by checking out the quickstarts for [safety](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Safety.ipynb), [embeddings](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Embeddings.ipynb), and [function calling](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Function_calling.ipynb). 

**Examples**
* Check out the [examples](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook/tree/main/examples) folder in the cookbook for more.

**Get help**
* Ask questions and get help in the new [Google AI Developer Forum](https://discuss.ai.google.dev).

Thank you for developing with Gemini! Weâ€™re excited to see what you create.
